    <h4>It's all about dreams...</h4>
<p>Airplane sliding down to the ocean…</p>
<p></p>
<p>When I was travelling to my home on a train I saw a dream of travelling in an airplane.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I saw myself flying in an ocean, the plane was too fast in speed.</p> 
<p>Pilot was trying to take off but I am not sure what was actually pulling it towards the surface of ocean.</p>
<p>Literally I got very scared but enjoyed this adventour at the same time.</p>

<p>I don’t understand why this dream came to me but it was a nightmare.</p>

<p> Minidor flying from top of the hills... </p>
<p> This dream seems to be very horryfying one as it let our life endangered...
The Minidor was literally flying from top of the hill down to the road...
I was just seeing them all getting smashed on the ground...
No loss of life...
No shattering minidors..
Everything was jumping like a ball...
It was a good but scary dream altogether...To be remembered!
